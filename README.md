# Deep-Q-Learning-Network-for-Adaptive-2048

This project proposes a reinforcement learning approach to solve a variation of
the traditional 2048 game called ‘Adaptive 2048’.The adaptive algorithm aims to
make the game harder and more challenging to obtain a perfect score of 2048 when
compared to a regular 2048 game. A deep Q-learning agent was used to solve this
problem since there was almost an infinite number of states, making it infeasible
for the agent to solve the problem using just Q-learning. The Deep Q-learning
agent was able to obtain a maximum score of 512 after training for a total of 5000
episodes.
